## About:
A fun word game where in order to win, the user must guess the secret 5-letter word by guessing words, and using hints they get from each word they try. Can *you* guess the word?

## Getting started:
You can play the game by clicking [this link](https://zacharywj.github.io/wordle-app/), right now! Just load the game in your browser to get started. The instructions for how to play are listed below, as well as in a drop down menu in the top left of the game's browser.

## How to play:
+ Load the game in browser. Wordle automatically selects a 5-letter word from it's word bank for you to guess! You have 6 guesses. Start by typing in a 5-letter word of your choice. The game then evaluates your guess and tells you if you got any of the letters right!

+ For each of the letters in your guess that are **NOT** in the secret word, their box is colored gray. 

+ If a letter of your guess is in the word, but not in the right position, it is colored **pink.**

+ If the letter is in the word AND in the right position within the secret word, it's colored **cyan.**

+ Use the clues given from each of your guesses, and their letters, to try and come up with the secret word by your 6th, *final* guess.

+ If you guess the secret word, you win!

+ If you do not, and you've used all 6 of your guesses, the game is over and you lose. The game will then tell you what the correct answer was.
